Today's Verse: Zephaniah 3:17

'The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.'

Reflection:

This beautiful verse reminds us that God doesn't merely tolerate us—He delights in us with singing and rejoicing. When we feel inadequate or discouraged, we can remember that our Creator finds joy in relationship with us, not because of our performance but because of His unchanging love. Let this truth transform how you see yourself today: you are someone over whom God sings with joy.

## EXAMPLE RESPONSE (Multiple Verses):

Today's Verses: Ruth 1:1, Ruth 1:7, Ruth 1:14, Ruth 1:22

Ruth 1:1
'Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.'

Ruth 1:7
'Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.'

Ruth 1:14
'And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.'

Ruth 1:22
'So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.'

Reflection:

These verses from Ruth chapter 1 beautifully illustrate the journey from famine to harvest, from loss to hope. Ruth's decision to cling to Naomi despite uncertainty shows us that loyalty and faithfulness in relationships honor God, even when the path ahead seems unclear. Notice how the chapter begins with famine and ends with the beginning of harvest—a reminder that our seasons of difficulty are not permanent, and God is already preparing the blessing that follows our faithful choices. When you face decisions today, are you choosing the path of faithful commitment, trusting that God will honor your loyalty even when you cannot see the outcome?
